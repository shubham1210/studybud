views are controller here.
settings.py = is like pom.xml to add more packages, middleware and settings project 
urls.py = is just to add more path. root project has urls that contains the routes so sub module like pom.xml
base, api.
serializer are just way to change to json

migrations folder contains are the changes we made in models , so think it as liquibase that make changes and we can execute them
later.

admin.py is the module that use to requister models so we can able to see them on ui admin.
